I Am Free Now

There is silence all around,
Not a stir to make a sound, 
But the raindrops on the ground.
There’s no more pain inside.

In the whisper of the stars, 
We destroyed this world of ours,
Bridges burned inside our hearts.
At last I’m feeling free
From being good or bad.
My soul’s been walking on the edge for far too long.

I could stay to be with you 
I could stay to make it through
We could fake it, but in truth 
It’s but a silly game. 
Winds will blow, and in that noise 
I will soon forget your voice.
We’ll declare it null and void,
That love that burned our hearts.
How I would lose my mind!
My broken heart no longer has a place for you. 
There is silence all around.
Flames are rising in the cloud.
As the morning’s breaking out,
I've never felt so free.

I am free from love and hate,
Evil tongues that speculate,
From dictated twists of fate
And from those silly chains
Of being good or bad.
My broken heart no longer has a place for you.  

I am free now – Like a bird up in the sky
I am free now – I’ll re-teach myself to fly 
I am free now – Like the wind that knows no fear.
I am free now – For the first time, all is clear.

I am free now 2021
