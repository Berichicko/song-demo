I Am Free Now

There is silence all around,
Not a stir to make a sound, 
But the raindrops on the ground.
There’s no more pain inside.

In the whisper of the stars, 
We destroyed this world of ours,
Bridges burned inside our hearts.
At last I’m feeling free
From being good or bad.
My soul’s been walking on the edge for far too long.

I could stay to be with you 
I could stay to make it through
We could fake it, but in truth 
It’s but a silly game.
